# Dynamic prediction for multivariate longitudinal and time-to-event data using super learning and multivariate functional principal component analysis-based methods

This is a public repository containing the different documents related to Arnau Garcia's master thesis in the MESIO UPC. In this repository you will find both code files and pdf documents with the reports that were made in the course of the work. 

* Reports: find the reports made during the master's thesis in *SL_1stReport.pdf*, *SL_2ndReport*, *SL_3rdReport.pdf* and *multi_longitudinal_data_MMvsMFPCA.pdf*. In addition, the slides for the meetings where these reports were presented can be found at *slides_SLinJM_meeting1.pdf* as well as *slides_SLinJM_meeting2.pdf*.
* *PBC_analysis folder*: this folder contains all files used to do the case studies using the PBC dataset. 
* *simul_SL folder*: this folder contains all the .R files related with the simulation study conducted to assess super learning performance in the joint modeling context.
* *simul_MFPCA_missing*: this folder contains all the .R files used to conduct the simulation study in which we assessed MFPCA-based predictions robustness under different missing data scenarios.
* *simul_MFPCA* this folder contains all the files (R and Python files) related with the simulation study in which MFPCA-based methods, super learning procedure and multivariate joint models were compared.
